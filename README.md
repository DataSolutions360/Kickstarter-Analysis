# Kickstarter-Analysis

Overview of project:
	The play, “FEVER”, has come close to its fundraising goal in a short timespan.  This analysis is to compare and contrast results in relation to their:
•	Launch Dates
•	Funding Goals
The analysis will display how effective a campaign is based on the monetary goal, as well as the month of the year which the campaign is launched. 
Analysis and Challenges:  
Results:
Fundraising through the theatre has been deemed effective, with respect to the short amount of time, and reaching the fundraising goals.  We would like to know how her fundraising Play, “Fever”, has done in comparison to other fundraising campaigns.  This analysis will be using the same Kickstarter dataset to analyze the Outcomes based on Goals and Launch Date.
Conclusions drawn about Theater Outcomes by Launch Date:
Peaks months generally are from April through August, as seen in the PNG.  The number corresponding on the Y axis is percent of efficacy, due to goal being met and surpassed.
On the contrary, the least effective campaigns were ran October through March, with a brief pop in February.  These campaigns tend to be in the 50% efficacy rate of meeting the goal for fundraising.
Conclusion:  Fundraising Plays tend to be more efficient in summer months.  This could be due to more financial availability, better, and more cost effective choice of venue(leading to higher margins), or a combination of them. 
Limitations of the data:  There is no data supporting WHY these campaigns were canceled, successful, or failed.  There is also no data provided that states that campaigns could be running concurrently, as well.  This is very important in categorical data with a high level of granularity, because there needs to be additional data to accurately analyze WHY something is deemed a success, to measure to/against.  Also, why were campaigns canceled?  Were they failing, and then canceled to reduce costs?  If there was the value of “CANCELED” as a data point, historical data should be provided to act as a “benchmark” to sample against.
 
Conclusion drawn about Theater Outcomes based on Goals:
	Peaks efficacy(successful campaigns) hovers around 55% from goals 30000 to 45000, and has LOW efficacy at ranges of 25000 to 30000 and 45000 and higher.
